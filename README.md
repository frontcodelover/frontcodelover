<h1>Hello World, I am Nicolas ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<p>Passionate about development for 15 years, I dedicated the early years of my journey to personal development projects, including affiliate marketing and websites. In 2022, I took a professional turn by intensively training in Front-End development, which allowed me to gain expertise in JavaScript, Typescript, React, Next.js and more.</p>

<p>Today, I wish to grow within a supportive and innovative team, where I can contribute with my technical skills and my ability to translate usecases into concrete solutions.</p>
